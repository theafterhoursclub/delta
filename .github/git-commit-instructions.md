Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description.
Use imperative mode: 'Add feature' not 'Added feature'.
Keep subject line under 50 characters.
Use types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci.
Include scope when relevant (e.g., api, ui, auth).
For additional details, use a well-structured body section.
Use bullet points (`*`) for clarity.
